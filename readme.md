The differences between customers who accepted and rejected the coupons can be observed across several key factors:

### **1\. Coupon Type:**

* **Bar Coupons**: Younger customers, in particular, were more inclined to accept bar-related coupons, which had a higher acceptance rate compared to restaurant and coffee house coupons.  
* **Restaurant & Coffee House Coupons**: Acceptance rates for these coupons were more evenly distributed, though they were influenced by factors such as customer income and the presence of passengers.

### **2\. Demographics:**

* **Age**:  
  * **Accepted**: Younger customers (under 30\) were more likely to accept coupons, especially those related to bars and social settings.  
  * **Not Accepted**: Older customers (over 30\) had lower acceptance rates, particularly for bar coupons.  
* **Income**:  
  * **Accepted**: Higher-income individuals were more likely to accept coupons, especially for entertainment and dining at higher-end establishments.  
  * **Not Accepted**: Lower-income individuals were less likely to accept bar coupons but were more interested in practical offers, such as discounts at less expensive restaurants.

### **3\. Passenger Influence:**

* **Accepted**: Drivers with adult passengers, such as partners or friends, were more likely to accept bar or coffee house coupons, suggesting that social settings increase the likelihood of acceptance.  
* **Not Accepted**: Drivers with children were less likely to accept bar-related coupons, indicating that family-oriented contexts decrease the appeal of such offers.

### **4\. Frequency of Visits:**

* **Accepted**: Frequent visitors to bars and coffee houses (more than three times a month) showed significantly higher acceptance rates for coupons related to these venues. They were more open to using coupons in places they regularly visit.  
* **Not Accepted**: Infrequent visitors to bars and restaurants were less likely to accept coupons, potentially because they saw less immediate value or were less inclined to make spontaneous decisions.

### **5\. Time of Day:**

* **Accepted**: Coupons sent during the evening or weekends, especially for bars, were more likely to be accepted, as customers were more likely to engage in leisure activities during these times.  
* **Not Accepted**: Coupons delivered during work hours or mornings were less frequently accepted, particularly for bar-related offers, as these times are less suitable for social activities.

### **Summary of Differences:**

* **Customers who accepted coupons**: Tended to be younger, have higher incomes, frequent social venues like bars and coffee houses, and were often accompanied by adult passengers. The timing of the coupon and its type played important roles in their decision to accept.  
* **Customers who rejected coupons**: Were more likely to be older, with lower incomes, and less frequent visitors to bars and restaurants. They were also more inclined to reject offers if they had children with them or if the coupon was delivered at less convenient times (such as during work hours).

By understanding these differences, businesses can refine their marketing strategies to more effectively target customers based on their likelihood of accepting coupons.

The differences between customers who accepted and did not accept the coupons can be identified across several key areas:

### **1\. Coupon Type:**

* **Bar Coupons**: Customers, especially younger ones, were more likely to accept bar-related coupons. These coupons had higher acceptance rates compared to restaurant or coffee house coupons.  
* **Restaurant & Coffee House Coupons**: Acceptance was more balanced but tended to be influenced by customer demographics such as income and the presence of passengers.

### **2\. Demographics:**

* **Age**:  
  * **Accepted**: Younger customers (under 30\) were more likely to accept coupons, especially for bars and social venues.  
  * **Not Accepted**: Older customers (over 30\) showed lower acceptance rates, particularly for bar-related coupons.  
* **Income**:  
  * **Accepted**: Higher-income customers were more inclined to accept coupons, particularly for entertainment and dining at more expensive establishments.  
  * **Not Accepted**: Lower-income individuals were less likely to accept bar coupons but showed more interest in practical discounts (e.g., lower-cost restaurant coupons).

### **3\. Passenger Influence:**

* **Accepted**: Drivers with adult passengers (such as partners or friends) were more likely to accept bar and coffee house coupons, suggesting that social contexts promote higher acceptance of coupons related to entertainment.  
* **Not Accepted**: Drivers with children were less likely to accept bar coupons, indicating that family-oriented scenarios reduce the likelihood of engaging with such offers.

### **4\. Frequency of Visits:**

* **Accepted**: Customers who frequent bars and coffee houses (more than 3 times a month) had significantly higher acceptance rates for coupons related to these venues. They were more open to taking advantage of offers in places they visit regularly.  
* **Not Accepted**: Infrequent visitors to bars and restaurants were less likely to accept coupons, as they might not see immediate value in the offer or are less inclined to make spontaneous decisions.

### **5\. Time of Day:**

* **Accepted**: Coupons offered in the evenings or on weekends, particularly for bars, were more likely to be accepted, as these are times when customers are more open to social or leisure activities.  
* **Not Accepted**: Coupons delivered during the workday or morning hours were less frequently accepted, especially for bar-related offers, as these are less appropriate times for engaging with such activities.

### **Summary of Differences:**

* **Customers who accepted coupons** tended to be younger, have higher incomes, frequently visit social venues (like bars and coffee houses), and were often in social contexts with adult passengers. Timing and the type of coupon also played crucial roles in their decision-making.  
* **Customers who rejected coupons** were more likely to be older, with lower incomes, and infrequent visitors to bars and restaurants. They were also more likely to reject offers if they were driving with children or if the coupon was delivered at a less convenient time (such as during work hours).

Understanding these differences can help businesses refine their marketing strategies to better target customers based on their likelihood of accepting coupons.
